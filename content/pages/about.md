## Trivia

In 2008 I was contacted by a Google recruiter, but miserably failed in the third stage of their interview process. This missed opportunity was a consequence of embracing, during that period, the role of a pure functional consultant, which left me with poor coding skills.

Six month later I found out that I [wrote the best open-source payroll software](http://kevin.deldycke.com/2008/06/best-open-source-payroll-software/) of the world. That distinction was awarded by the company that is now my employer (so I doubt it counts).

In 2009 I gave an [interview with my bandmates from Cool Cavemen](http://kevin.deldycke.com/2009/11/cool-cavemen-creative-commons-moi/), in which I explained (in French), how we came to use Creative Commons licenses to distribute [our music](http://jamendo.com/artist/cool.cavemen).

Finally in 2010, using some skewed statistics, I found that [I'm a top-1% developer](http://kevin.deldycke.com/2011/03/top-1-percent-open-source-developer/).

## Resume

If my appalling attempts to impress with the trivia above did not worked on you, you may be thrilled by the following soporific information on my professional background:

Format | Language | Status
---|---|---
PDF | [English](http://docs.google.com/a/deldycke.com/document/export?format=pdf&id=1XaJgwRAhxHDuBSD-JqE--8WKGx0uTasa6IOU4IFBeKg) ● [French](http://docs.google.com/a/deldycke.com/document/export?format=pdf&id=1JYITJ3JU9WYvQXWlpGqLO9LzhcfAxiqJSsV8WyVhyyY) | Up to date
LinkedIn | [English](http://linkedin.com/in/kevindeldycke/en) ● [French](http://linkedin.com/in/kevindeldycke/fr) | Synced

Resumes, CVs and profiles above are heavy on details you may not be interested in as a recruiter. If to you these documents are too verbose and contain superfluous information, then that's absolutely normal.

In fact, I designed these documents as a kind of extensive "professional activities databases". Not as resume _per se_. So feel free to pick there information you need and please ignore the rest.

## About this blog

This blog is a way to share all my open-source contributions and
experimentations. It's also an evolving notebook where I deposit tiny pieces of
knowledge (*knowledgelets*?) I generate in my personal and professional
activities.

This blog is also the final container of all the unnecessary details I don't
bother to keep in memory. It's so easy to clutter a mind nowadays... Sometimes,
the [information this blog transport can be
life-savers](http://kevin.deldycke.com/2008/07/heroic-journey-to-raid-5-data-recovery/).
And that's when I realize the effort of maintaining a blog is not vain.

I try to write everything in English, as a way to practice, and to make my
knowledge available to the largest audience. As it's not my mother tongue,
you’ll surely find mistakes. If you do, please be kind enough to comment on the
blog so I can fix it as soon as possible.

I sometimes write [posts in French](http://kevin.deldycke.com/category/francais/)
if I consider their content much more relevant to a French-speaking audience.

This blog was previously named *coolkevmen*, which is the nickname given to me
by [Cool Cavemen](http://coolcavemen.com), and under which I appear in the
[All Cool Hits](http://coolcavemen.com/disc/all-cool-hits/) credits.

As for the image header, it was a gift of Jim from
[Maomium](http://maomium.com). Check the [story behind this
illustration](http://kevin.deldycke.com/2011/01/new-blog-header-and-tiny-wordpress-theme-customizations/).
