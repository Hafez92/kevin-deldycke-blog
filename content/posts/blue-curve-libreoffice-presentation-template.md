category: English
tags: Creative Commons, libreoffice, openoffice, presentation, slide, Template

Sorting my archives, I uncovered an old collection of presentations I created in 2001/2002 when I was a student. I've just generated out of these original slides templates for LibreOffice.

First, here is [Blue Curve](http://templates.libreoffice.org/template-center/blue-curve-1):

You can [download the file](http://templates.libreoffice.org/template-center/blue-curve-1/releases/1.0/blue-curve.otp) from the [official LibreOffice templates](http://templates.libreoffice.org/template-center) website.

Second presentation template is [Fancy Window Frame](http://templates.libreoffice.org/template-center/fancy-window-frame):

And if for any reason the LibreOffice repository is down, here are mirror of the templates served from my site: [Blue Curve](http://kevin.deldycke.com/documents/blue-curve.otp) & [Fancy Window Frame](http://kevin.deldycke.com/documents/fancy-window-frame.otp).
